# Bradley's Personal Todo List CLI
This is my personal todo list.

I'm using this project as an excuse to learn more about Python, plus it's fun to write programs that I can actually use on a day to day basis.

This repo is only public so anybody can look at the code if they're interested, but if you wanted to use it for yourself you'd have to change some hardcoded filepaths and stuff.
